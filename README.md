# WACSO
WACSO is a simple application that plays the phrase "Welcome Aboard, Captain. All systems online"  from the cyclops in Subnautica when your Mac successfully boots up.   This is truly only a quick project I made in a couple of hours, and I cannot promise any future update or revisions. However, if you have suggestions, please let me know!


Installation/setup instructions:

Step 1: Drag the WACSO app to the Applications folder. Enter your administrator password if needed.

Step 2: Drag the WACSO folder to the Application Support folder. Enter your administrator password if needed. 

Step 3: Open System Preferences

Step 4: Click on “Users and Groups”

Step 5: Click the “Login items” tab.

Step 6: Click the Plus at the bottom of the list, and find WACSO in your Applications folder. When it has been added to the list, tick the box that says “Hide”.

Step 7: Enjoy! You will now hear the soothing sounds of the cyclops whenever you boot up your computer.
